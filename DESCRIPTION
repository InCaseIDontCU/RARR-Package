Description: This package introduces eight residual analysis methods to check the OLS model's adequacy and four robust regression models to adjust the original OLS model.
    Residual Analysis: Part1(Residuals Scaling) including five methods to calculate Standardized Residuals, Studentized Residuals, PRESS statistic, Standardized PRESS Residuals, R-student Residuals. Part2(Residual Plots) including three methods to visualize Normal Probability Plot, Plot of Residuals Against Fitted Values, and Plot of Residuals Against Regressor of scaling residuals.
    Robust Regression: including four functions to implement Huber's function, Hampel's funtion, Ramsay's function and Andrews' wave function.
