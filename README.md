# RARR-Package
A Package for Residual Analysis and Robust Regression
## Purpose
Introduce some residual analysis methods and implement robust regression to improve OLS model.
## About
RARR package introduces eight residual analysis methods to check the OLS model's adequacy and four robust regression models to adjust the original OLS model.  

Residual Analysis: Part1(Residuals Scaling) including five methods to calculate Standardized Residuals, Studentized Residuals, PRESS statistic, Standardized PRESS Residuals, R-student Residuals. Part2(Residual Plots) including three methods to visualize Normal Probability Plot, Plot of Residuals Against Fitted Values, and Plot of Residuals Against Regressor of scaling residuals.  
Robust Regression: including four functions to implement Huber's function, Hampel's funtion, Ramsay's function and Andrews' wave function.
